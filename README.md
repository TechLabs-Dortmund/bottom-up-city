# Bottom-up.city
Create a web app that helps people find bike sharing and car sharing services, additionally co-working spaces or other data which might be interesting for people to to reduce mobility. Idea: People don't want to move between different areas of a city, they search for solution nearby.  

## How to Setup and Run
In order to setup the project, please proceed as follows:
Navigate to the React App with Leaflet folder using terminal. Then run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

To run the project, execute the following command. It will start a local development server which can show the application in the browser

```bash
  npm start
```

## Examples
You can see a brief overview of how to use the main functionality below.
Languages WebDev: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet

```javascript
import Component from 'my-project'

function App() {
  return <Component />
}
```
The first step to use our web app is the search bar: The user types in the place where she or he wants to see the results. With a click on a “search”-button, the map changes to the user-given place. As a next step, the user can decide between the three given kinds of data. To get the data on the map and in the list, the user clicks on one of the three buttons. After that, the map and the list show the data the user is searching for. The results are also given in a list because some people struggle with the handling of maps, so that also people who do not like to use maps or don not know how to read them can use our web app.
